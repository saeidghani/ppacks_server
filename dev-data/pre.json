  "text": "This little backpack got me through 12 days of traveling Europe! I used a few space saver bags as well, but was able to bring 4 pairs of pants, 7 shirts, and 1 dress, then wore a few things twice. It held up really well throughout, and fit dimensions for WOW, Vueling, and EasyJet.",

  "text": "If I could give this backpack a 10 stars I would. It completely exceeded my expectations in quality, design, color, and price. The amount of pockets and space that this backpack gives me is amazing!! I needed a new backpack that would hold my laptop, textbooks, binders, etc for nursing school and this was beyond perfect! Especially since I’m only 5’2 and most backpacks ride low and make my shoulders slouch forward when it’s heavy but this backpack sits perfectly on my spine and I don’t slouch. There is so much padding on the straps, back, and inside for the laptops that I feel comfortable and my laptop is properly supported. The side pockets fit my huge water bottles and they don’t fall out of the pockets like it did with my last backpack (HUGE PLUS). I can even fit my 40oz hydro flask in the side pockets! The phone charger connection works (that is my own white portable charger) and I was charging my phone on the backpack while taking photos. Although I got this backpack for school I will definitely be utilizing it for travel this summer as well! I still can’t believe I only paid $29 for this!! Best purchase I’ve ever made on amazon so far!",

  "text": "I waited a few months of using this bag prior to writing a text. Still loving it! I use it primarily during the week for work in a corporate environment. The bags on wheels tend to slow me down a bit and briefcases for me, are tight on storage and just don't match my organizational preferences. This bag serves as the perfect mobile office for me. Lots of room/storage. 1 laptop, 1 MacBook, 1 big size happy planner, 1 classic size happy planner, lots of highlighters, pens, a binder, textbook, and still more room to go. I also use it on the weekend for our daughters volleyball tournaments. Inside I pack my work laptop, med kit, lunch and snacks for the hubs and I, iPad for recording, tripod on the side, and usually a pair of sneakers in case I want to change shoes. It's also served as a carry on bag for flights. This bag is well made and serves many purposes. Very happy that I purchased it. I am very picky when it comes to functionality of bags and this was a great purchase.",

  "text": "This backpack looks small from the outside but it easily fits my 15.6 inch laptop, ipad, ring binder, mouse, pens pencils and still has some room. It is lightweight and professional looking. I really like all of the pockets and storage options. I've only had it a couple of weeks so I am anxious to see how the fabric holds up. The fabric looks nice, more like a business suit rather than the plastic looking backpacks",

  "text": "Carrying a laptop, a power lead, all the various bits that go with travelling IT plus loads of papers in a traditional laptop case was really giving me sore shoulders and an aching back so I decided to look for a simple, non-flashy but well made backpack and after comparing literally dozens and all of the associated texts I settled on the Matein and it has already proved itself to be exactly what I was looking for. It is extremely well made with a nice, smooth and smart dark grey fabric finish that seems at least drizzle proof. It has loads of storage within 6 separate zipped pockets and appears to weigh virtually nothing when it is loaded and on my back. An excellent purchase!",

I didn’t realize there was a technology pocket with a way to charge it so that’s pretty cool too. Also my cat likes sitting on it.",
